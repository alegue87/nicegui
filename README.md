# NiceGUI Multiple components suite

The suite of Vue components available for usage in the develop mode ( prod_js = False ) are:

- Naive UI
  - Button
  - Datepicker
  - Menu
- Vuetify
  - Button
  - Datepicker
- PrimeVue
  - Button
  - Datepicker
- Element
  - Button
  - Datepicker

With production mode enabled they are individually selectionable with argument: ui_components_suite="naive" ( only implemented at the moment, the default is quasar suite ).

## Installation

The installation in only for setup a dev environment with a python venv and the step are:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alegue87/nicegui.git
```


Enter in multi_ui example in the repository cloned:

```bash
cd nicegui/examples/multi_ui
```

Create venv with python ( maybe need python >= 3.10 )

```bash
python -m venv test_multi_ui
```

Link nicegui framework in the library folder of the venv. For example if you
are in multi_ui folder and you use python3.10 the command is:

```bash
ln -s $PWD/../../nicegui/ test_multi_ui/lib/python3.10/site-packages/nicegui
```

Source the environment

```bash
source bin/activate
```

Install the requirement with pip ( located in example/multi_ui folder )

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Execute the example from examples/multi_ui folder
```bash
python main.py
```

The GUI is now available through http://localhost:8081/ in your browser.
Note: NiceGUI will automatically reload the page when you modify the code.

The component suite loaded are directly available in the code with Element('vue-tag-name') and in the future the more complex one will be wrapped in
python like datepickers and menus. 

## Original Documentation and Examples

The documentation is hosted at [https://nicegui.io/documentation](https://nicegui.io/documentation) and provides plenty of live demos.
The whole content of [https://nicegui.io](https://nicegui.io) is [implemented with NiceGUI itself](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/main.py)
and can be started locally with `docker run -p 8080:8080 zauberzeug/nicegui` or by executing `main.py` from this repository.

In our wiki we have a list of great [NiceGUI projects from the community](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/wiki#community-projects), a section with [Tutorials](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/wiki#tutorials), a growing list of [FAQs](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/wiki/FAQs) and [some strategies for using ChatGPT / LLMs to get help about NiceGUI](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/wiki#chatgpt).

## Why?

We at [Zauberzeug](https://zauberzeug.com) like [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
but find it does [too much magic](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/issues/1#issuecomment-847413651) when it comes to state handling.
In search for an alternative nice library to write simple graphical user interfaces in Python we discovered [JustPy](https://justpy.io/).
Although we liked the approach, it is too "low-level HTML" for our daily usage.
But it inspired us to use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) for the frontend.

We have built on top of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/),
which itself is based on the ASGI framework [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/)
and the ASGI webserver [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)
because of their great performance and ease of use.
